1) At some point in my life, I realized pears were frightening in some unusual way. It's like le monke philosop, in that pears already have innate qualities that cannot be changed without causing some sort of adverse reaction. From my experience people see strange things when they look at pears. Like beans, pears have the quality of some sort of null meaning that cannot really be explained. Or are extremely difficult to pin down exactly what it is.}

2) Some anime from my experience have aspects of it that are not frightening to onlookers when they should be. Being so situational, it confuses people and their experience becomes one of obsession. From that lack of understanding, there are gaps that have unusual results. Not what you would normally expect from something so unusual. It's like grazing through rings of meaning. }

Aside from this some potential aspects of interest include waves that intercept kind of air. It's like the pixels of these shows are individual parts that constitute a new whole, it doesn't make sense that such infinitetesimal small parts can be replicated by human hands, but perhaps in a strange way}

3) Beans. Beans are quite scary but their meaning is offset by things like Mexican wrestlers or words that appear frightening like "beaner". They kind of represent some sort of unusual dark that goes beyond grassy knolls. It seems like, because they are ordinarily, but universally, green, that it's a simple matter of knotting them up with other such things, but in reality, they possess far darker traits that previously imagined. It's difficult to proceed any further due to lack of any transient meaning.}

4) Sunny day. To fully explain the context behind this "Pokemon Move", one has to understand what Pokemon games exibit. First of all everything in Pokemon is turn based within battles. These battles occur in standard JRPG style in that you must move around a 2 dimensional map from a sky view. You go around completing quests and such in that you should progress along a linear storyline, to sum it up in a very semi-accurate and boring way. There is a lot more to it than meets the eye. It starts off in New Bark town, which is one of many cities that you travel through. Along the way you get aquainted with people, battle people in gyms and collect rare and unusual items. The experience is key. There are legendary pokemon that you can collect.}

6) Yeah no shit. It seems like there are some things of seeming minor importance but it's always important to remember that within a physical context strange phenomena of bad proportions can be isolated in a physical way. }

7) Green, yellow, orange and pear letter. It's a strange phenomenom that resembles horror or monotony specifically, but more to the point all 12 or anything else within range. A fan effect demonstration. }

8) There are certain death zones that qualify as paradoxical. Such paradoxes embody a theory of forms that are alterable on a fundamental level. Such things kill. These dead zones are in actuality something of a strange phenomenom.. It's difficult to say exactly why but there is a fundamental flaw in your reasoning. There is quite a few ways to go about this, one such way to to recognize that there is everything at a high level is quite paradoxical to begin with. Not in the way you'd expect, no. But to put it simply, it is extremely difficult to comprehend. }

To understand how to obtain a Paradox, one must understand what a paradox truely is. An example is "there is an exception to every rule". But to take it to its logical end, this rule itself would possess an exception. That exception being that there is an exception to this rule itself. So how does one resolve this issue. It's left up in the air. Should "there be an exception to every rule" or should every rule have no exceptions. This is the only other way to look at it. 1 becoming two in otherwards. And one again, every true rule has absolutely no exceptions.}

During a peculiar night, outside of our current context involving our MC's is a group of teenageers getting drunk. Upon getting drunk they decide its high time to play some PS2 games. It is late. They decide upon Halo 3. Instead some picture-esque game pops up out of the blue. It is similar to an exploration type game but with ships of some variety. In this game within the context of the game are our six main characters. The middle aged caucasian male is not out of place. They are dead set on winning the game to get some prize. The main characters on the good side must get out of the swamp alive in order to win the prize. The main swamp monster is preventing them from achieving this goal.

Done with that, they walk inside the empty apartment. There are several tables with various symbolic devices on them and a number of other objects of minimal meaning. It is difficult to spot but very possible. There is a Bean on the table. It appears to be an edamame (a Bean of Japanese Origin). It means Edamame. Paradoxically enough you have to find the meaning otherwise there is no meaning to be found at first.}

(1) At the start of out short story are a group of kids going to a festival. They are excited to go to the festival. The festival appears to be very fun. At the festival is a variety and assortment of activities and treats to be had. From my experience it includes Takoyaki and Takoyaki accessories and sundries. There are many drinks to be had including sodas and carbonated beverages of a juicy variety, which are not sodas by the way. They also have normal juices and some other drinks. It appears that everything is organized in a row format, and there are many Anime Expo-esque-esque structures about. Some people are at food stands, other are at drink stands, and furthermore - others are at the manga stands. What is about to happen, no one really knows -}

(2) The six main characters are all scatters somewhere in the beginning of the story. They are on a mission to complete a quest in real life. Or two. Either way they have to work together in a WoW-esque pick-up-group in order to schlong together some epic prize. It seems pretty easy.}

(3) They group up and reach the house. They are already pretty hammered tbh. They begin the game. The End. In the game, it is Virtual Reality-esque-esque. They are inside a seemingly mundane house. The surrounding environment reeks of brown, log, mahogany and log colors. The envionment is very enticing and self-absorbing. It feels unusual to say the least, in contrast to its base appearance. It is what appears to be an old house of some variety. They must solve some puzzles now. }

They are wandering through the house, when they decide to play a videogame called Revenge of the Swamp Monster. The game is about a swamp monster that wants to rule a swamp, but some kids come in and start making a big ruckus. The main characters start playing the video game and wandering through the swamp. There doesn't seem to be a lot to the game since it is so boring they decide to stop and look around the room instead. It resembles the starting house room in one of the first gen pokemon games. Inside the room is another game console, that looks exactly like a first gen Nintendo 64. They end up playing some racing game on it. It appears to be a badly animated 8 bit game not fit for a more new gen console like the Nintendo. There is a box of games right next to the Nintendo. They decide to open the box in search of new game to play that might be more up to date, graphics-wise. There is enough space inside to cover two areas with extended square game cases. Obviously there are the games inside. The top two games are bit pong and some original issue Mr. Game and Watch Flatzone game. What lies beneath it, obviously the more next gen games. They reach for the games below it.}

Before the main characters which are children and kids can play the games below it, they must first try Bit Pong and Flatzone. It is a very peculiar game with a highly developed OG environment. They get owned by the Bot of Bit Pong a couple times before moving on to Flatzone. Mr.Game and Watch hard locks it so they can't get past the intro level. Alright, so under those games is first, a highly original version of Mario Kart 2, and next to the Ratchet and Clank the Precursor 64. They decide Mario Kart 2 would be extremely boring, so they try the Ratchet and Clank game first. So the graphics are an exactly copy of the graphics from the Super Mario 64 and also 3D. It begins in the original storyline, but about 3 games back, on average, relative to the next couple games. Dr. Quark is the current reigning champion of the Online Battle Arena, with a couple of his Noids. Ratchet and Clank, respectively, are still in Clank's apartment playing video games. All they have is the PS2. They are playing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Ratchet recently got fired from his job as hotel security. And Clank pays for the apartment expenses as a part-time actor at the Visual Club. Literally all they do all day is play PS2 games and sometimes browse the internet for random YourTube.Com videos of funny things. It is a very interesting lifestyle. }

Dr. Quark's Krib is the very center of the planet, relatively speaking. He is under the guise of a gentlemen at the present time. Under his close watch, Dr.Quark is allowed to wander around the precipice without supervision. But whenever he gets lost of needs assistance, he can contact Krib Wilson for instructions regarding what he should be doing.

 shell of the quantum physics. He is determined to find out is there is a quark particle indeed. He currently is under the assumption that is green. The scientific community at large on the planet is more of a questionable attitude regarding his theories at the time. Dr. Quark is known to take a very roundabout approach in resolving matters of quantum importance. He is known to swing around his Krib and likes botany and taking care of certain Japanese-esque plants. With the help of his gardener and caretaker, Krib Wilson, of course. He has been known to imitate certain professionals of an ornate nature regarding quantum principles, but presently with little success. It is unknown at the time if he'll shed any light on his progress, but it is certain he'll reach the 7}{{\*\updnprop10000}\up9\afs22\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs22\lang9

So our main character are browsing around, already have visited the drink stands and food stands. They continue to browse around the manga stands. They are beginning to wonder if there are anime stands. It appears our main characters have forgotten there are anime stands strangely enough. It is ok, because they go there anyways. They are at AX. It should be noted that this worlds' Los Angeles and Foster City are directly connected somehow. And Mountain House has a portal to those destinations. There first destination takes them to the Kuro Mukuro stand. It is a very peculiar anime. It works every time \'96 the stand says. What works everytime, our main cast wonders. The orator of the stand is an old guy with semi-balding hairstyle. He approaches them in a very traditionally Japanese way. Upon turning to face them he seems to know what they are here for. \'93Is it unclear why, up until now you haven't thought too much of this show?\'94 he asks mysteriously. Our main characters look at him quizically. He continues, \'93We have different ways of looking at things. Sometimes it is Kuro Mukuro. Other times it is a show about femboys riding pirate ships. It really depends on our way of seeing the world in the show.\'94 He begins to stroke his fu man chu beard comtemplatively. He goes on, \'93It is a very mysterious phenomenon that guides our characters from this show to the next.\'94 He points to a distant stand and recinds his hand, walking to the very back of his stand, sitting down on a stool. Our main characters know that there is another knotch in the chain of events. The next one being the stand the old mysterious man has pointed to. One more glance at him assures our violet-eyed femboy that he will indeed make another appearance. They move on.}

Our main cast at Anime Expo, move on to the next stand. The path to the next stand is so spiritually dense, that it is like moving through a thick fog. They can still see through it though. This, they can tell is a sign that the next stand will be extra-significant. At the end of their traversal through the fog-esque landscape, they reach the stand without much effort. Le man opens his stand, staring the violet-eyed femboy down. He loses the duel, le man does. \'93OK, I concede.\'94 Le man begins to wander around in a figure eight and stops, sitting on a stool. His stool is brown, brown. \'93Anyhow, what brings you to this corner of the Anime Expo,\'94 Le man asks. \'93I am not entirely certain,\'94 the violet-eyed femboy intercedes, \'93I was hoping you would enlighten us.\'94}

\'93}{\afs22\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs22\lang9
Well, regarding these matters at hand, I have but one response,  \'93 Le man says, very plainly. \'93It is a simple matter of auramancy.\'94}
\par \pard\plain \s0{\*\hyphen2\hyphlead2\hyphtrail2\hyphmax0}\nowidctlpar\cf0\hich\af3\langfe1033\dbch\af3\afs24\lang1081\loch\f3\fs24\lang1033\sl276\slmult1\sb0\sa200{\afs22\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs22\lang9
Le man begins explaing to our main cast of characters about the artistic expression involving a hall of mirrors and its direct relation to auramancy at large, as a general expression of its craft. As a matter of exposition, we'll shorten Le man's monologue into parts of the whole. First, he would say, auramancy is the expulsion of one's internal spiritual pressure. Not so brisk, one would rather it be exterted in a continuous stream of aura. Otherwise you risk unwanted effects. The difference between this technique and one of more peculiar specializations, is that auras encircle the bodily form entirely. It is not efficient to enpower a subsection of one's bodily form. It is because it automatically utilizes aura to required areas in equal amounts relative to the center. So focusing your energy is like making it only guard your hand or something. It's not good.}
\par \pard\plain \s0{\*\hyphen2\hyphlead2\hyphtrail2\hyphmax0}\nowidctlpar\cf0\hich\af3\langfe1033\dbch\af3\afs24\lang1081\loch\f3\fs24\lang1033\sl276\slmult1\sb0\sa200{\afs22\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs22\lang9
Anyways, after a short admission, he goes on to explain the techniques with weaponry, since it is highly intuitive and requires bong level spiritual level to utilize to begin with. The weapon specific techniques are somewhat counter-intuitive as one would assume that by leaving one's bodily form area, that the blade would be uncharged. This is not necessarily the case, as an aura is not directly shaped like a barrier shell. But rather exudes aura from a center. So that means any sort of extension of one's spiritual medium is encapsulated within the general auric activity. It is not supposed to be easily visible, unless one is expressing massive spiritual activity. Then you can literally see it. It is entirely discrete from the wave activity of highly dense spiritual beings. But you can sort of make it out when exerted outside of one's sovereign space provided your perception is advanced enough. Most of the time it is entirely discrete, however. }

Giving a quizical, highly mysterious expression of deep, deep knowing and understanding, Le man continues, \'93 I am not well versed on those artistic expressions, ya mean . \'93 He continues, once again, \'93 I do however have a wide variety of odd figurines, some of which do not presently exist in your anime medium at large.\'94 The examine info indicates, 'It buzzes with mediums of spiritual auric energy, the pressure would be enormous for average gentleman. ' This was surprising in of itself, that Le man, who normally delves into the more subtle arts of Synergy would be so knowledgable and understandable or this great, but profound mystery. This subtlety would however, not go unnoticed. \'93 This is a great way to end this meeting for the time present. I will return at a later time to talk about other things of high importance. \'93 }

There are many mysteries of the universe, and it can not be said that we can consiously apprehend them 100% of the time. But to be certain, we can know about some of them, all of the time. There is a, little visited subsection of the Anime Expo experience, that is very bong. A lot of taxi cabs, cars, trucks and buses pass through this area delivering passengers of the more toxic variety to this destination. It is in some areas known as the coal burner. A lot of the other Anime Expo experience would be completely, if not entirely wasted on these passengers. They just would not understand things on a more interesting level. It is more of a boxing in technique-esque-esque capability that they possess. Not very good if I had to say so myself. But further inquiry is a gigantic waste of effort and time.}

At some point in the day, comes a time when there is an end to the days festivities and a night of fun begins. The festival is a direct interlude to the Expo's more subtle features. In The Night Festival many things happen. It should be noted that blue drinks are more acceptable now. A little known fact is that outside of our festival exists a fully explorable zone within the woods. Certain spirits and strange flora are known to inhabit the area during dusk hours. They do glow in the dark. More subtle forms of expression are possible. But require multiple returns to the same location. It is cool.}

He begins each day the same way, waking up and kind of getting out of bed when going to school is boring. He usually sleeps during class.

The school is as usual all the time. Not much interesting. There is a mascot out front, of some stone sculpture. Hanging flags of odd-colors adorn the front of the school.

In art class, he remembers he forgot his notebook. Instead of buying a blank sheet art book like everyone else, he just bought an ordinary notebook with blue lines. All he really remembers about it, is that it is unusally large for a blue line notebook. He asks the girl next to him if he can borrow a piece of paper to make due for the time being. She looks at him strangely and obliges. Well then, he thinks, it turned out decently. The art man in the front of the class introduces a book of odd art. It looks stupid to him. He is not a fan of modernized art. The art teacher flips to the next page. It's an impressionistic drawing that doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the book's modern art at all. He decides instead that it is ok after all. He has a high aptitude for drawing. He attempts to draw the impressionistic drawing but fails and it comes out looking not very good.}

(1) In stories, there are plants in certain places that dictate how a story goes, that are seemingly innoucuous. A gun may be in chapter one, but must go off in chapter three. These are false leads that dictate how a plot twist goes. In the first part of the first chapter, our main character is in his house. But that day, for whatever reason, his cereal box is in the wrong location. It is usually located in the cupboard above the rice. But today it was sitting outside next to the fridge. Way to the left. This may seem like absolutely nothing at first, like who really cares in a cereal box is located in the middle of nowhere for some ordinary reason like his mom or something forgetting to put it away. But in reality, it changed his entire morning. Instead of going downstairs to the right, he walked on the left-ish side. This led to him reading a different part of the back of his dad's newspaper, half-attentively. This led to him walking upstairds in a minorly different pattern. And his sight barely caught the back end of his art notebook. He didn't pay any attention to it and forgot completely what class it was for. And one thing leads to another, and ultimately he forgets his notebook completely that day. That is, until his class started.}

In his school that day, in the crowd outside, a homeless man from downtown wanders into the school grounds. If it is caused by his travails that morning, no one is really certain. This homeless man walked all the way, a mile and a half to the school and somehow blended into the crowd of students without drawing attention from the groundskeepers. Even the principal walks by and unknowingly ignores the homeless man. He is last seen hammering a strange looking willow tree with his right hand. The twist being, that our main character look directly at the homeless man hammering the tree and pays it no mind.}

Lastly, in art class, a strange kid enters the room late. Upon entering the room, a sheet of toilet paper falls to the floor seemingly from his back pocket. Our main character misses it completely. The entire class looks in surprise. The art man tells everyone to calm down, and welcomes the kid back into the class. It is still unclear if the book itself shifted images halfway through, which was where the non-modern art was located. Page 52, our main character thought. How bizarre, that only he would notice the irregularity.}

The first tactic I could use, is to recognize that technology plays a crucial role in making things kind of work together in our story. Just because it is monotonous, technology is, does not mean it can't sometimes be interesting. It is kind of like passageways that lead to interesting things, but only constitute a small portion of the maze. The recognition itself is a tactic that makes it so it doesn't ruin the plot. Because without it, our town would be in the stone ages and not the town at all. Also there would be no outside of the town, so the world would not make any sense at all. To put things into perspective, there is an airstrip a little ways down with strange planes created by an architect from Japan in the 1950s. But doesn't seem to be that way anywhere else.}

It definitely sucks ass sometimes, but it is only a small part of the greater whole and not very significant at all to the overall plot. To prevent it from sucking ass, technologically.

Our main character passes time playing mainly retrograde and 8-bit video games. This is actually impossible to have technology at this level this early. It somehow remains interesting.

Some people may be concerned with the viability of technology as a matter of interest. It seems monotonous for good reason, and that is mainly because most people, and by most I mean almost all people who are technologically heavy have absolutely no idea what they are doing. With technology that is. High-tech equipment is utilized only in the most base of ways and often times without any real flare. They just kind of slap shit together. Our main character works with circuit boards. He is an expert on fixing up his retro and arcade computers. This alone is a major plot-point and ancilliary to the plot as a whole.}

The story begins with our group of good guys, our six main characters who are at the festival. Basically they get together to complete a quest involving a video game. This video game is a playstation game. To beat it they have to escape from a swamp ruled by the swamp monster, who is another main character conflicting with the main characters who are the good guys. After they beat the game and the swamp monster, they get a set of virtual reality goggles to play the next level of the swamp monster game, but this time with virtual reality. The same main character swamp monster is the antagonist. But before they get to play this they head to the festival to get some takoyaki and ramunes.}

This is the first part of the story. Our main characters meet up after a message pops up on their super phones, wich are basically smart phones that have super capabilities. The technology in their story is much higher than real life technology. They have a game app on their super phones called \'93The Quests\'94. The quests are a in-real-life versions of a video game quest that happens automatically. If you complete quests on the app \'93The Quests\'94,  you get stuff in real life. They magically appear. Our current quest for the group of six good guys involves getting together and beating the Play Station game Revenge of the Swamp Monster together. At the festival they are starting at, they first go to check out a fortune teller stand, which seems out of place since fortune tellers are usually at carnivals. The fortune teller is in a kind of tent. She's sitting at a desk with a large crystal ball with swirling patterns within. She greets our six main character good guys and tells them they need to beat a game. Before they can ask what game, she notions that there is a game of throwing a ball in a cup in the festival that no one has won the grand prize for in over 20 years. Apparently it is notoriously hard to hit the center cup she notes. They leave her tent with this new information and head to the ball in a cup stand just south of the fortune teller. There is  a strange man in a cap with a circular table with red cups and one green cup in the center. If you can successfully land this small wooden ball into a cup, you win a prize, miss and you get nothing. They try attempt after attempt without any sort of success, landing the ball in the furthest most cup everytime, winning points towards a strange bauble. They get the bauble and then our violet eyed femboy decides it is high time to try something strange. He throws the ball like one would a baseball if one were to try to land it in the furthest possible distance from himself. It flies in an ordinary arc and lands in the green cup. The strange man seems unsurprised and brings out an incredibly dusty box containing an odd PS2 console. Game not-inclusive, he states. They leave quickly and decide to head back to their apartment.}

At the apartment they suddenly realize that their apartment contains an attic. They glance in varying directions and one of them notices a handle to an attic that no one payed any attention to before. Inside is a bunch of old furniture completely covered in cobwebs and dust everywhere. There is a pile of games, the top one being \'93Revenge of the Swamp Monster\'94. The others go unchecked and they simply bring them downstairs from the attic. There are clearly 8 others.}

They have to team up and work together to get out of the swamp, when the Swamp Monster is preventing them from leaving. The swamp monster is mad at them for invading his swamp and doesn't want them to leave because he is mad. Our main characters, especially the violet-eyed boy are very good at the game. The game console has six slots for game controllers, so all our good guys can play the game at the same time. The TV screen they play on is humungous. The Swamp Monster is being secretly played across the internet by another player who is a person in real life. But in the game he is playing as the Swamp Monster. He is the main antagonist of the story and directly causing conflict with our determined cast of good guys. }

They go through the swamp. There is only one big level, which is the swamp itself. The swamp monster plants traps to try and capture our good guys like cages and big nets mostly. He tries to attack them by hiding behind trees and running after them. The swamp monster player finds this game very interesting and fun to play. The good guys manage to avoid all the traps and swamp monster attacks and finally reach the end of the game where they win. It is a giant tree that they have to all touch together to win. The swamp monster is chasing them the whole time at the last part but they reach the tree too quickly for the swamp monster to get them.}

They finally win the game and get out. They all take out their super phones at the same time and a giant sound plays saying, You have won, congratulations!. A giant grid beam of light starts magically making a set of Virtual Reality goggles out of thin air. They are impressed by this magic. Afterwards our good guys head to the festival for a break from fighting the swamp monster. On their way there they pass by the Kool-Aid jug, who is doing a quest from \'93The Quest\'94 app. He is just walking the other way, our good guys are not sure what he is doing. They collectively reach one of the stands, by the way the festival and is basically a subset of Anime Expo. The stand is run by Le man. Who is there to edify them on the arts and crafts of auramancy. After they do this and learn how to do auramancy better with their mechanics, they go back the play Virtual Reality game \'93Revenge of the Swamp Monster\'94.

Swampburt is currently planning his next scheme. The main good guys ignore this for now so they can get more information from the house. They realize that it is a nice place with a pleasant environment. Upon reaching the end of the house. They go inside the door with no keyhole that is opened up for no good reason and win the level.}

There is more to the story than meets the eye. The swamp monster confictor main character with the good guys is just one part of the story. In another place nearby the average life in a upper-middle class neighborhood goes on without so much as a hitch. Our other main character who is a teenager is going through the daily routines of a monotonous life and plays lots of retrograde video games, and some arcade games. He is a pretty good guy with a good disposition all of the time.}

RL Stein notes that a good way to build suspense is to have all the main characters listed out and then have them get together in a good way. In another part of the world, the conflictor to our main character teenager who plays arcade games is the yellow Kool-Aid jug monster. He already knows about our main character teenager who plays arcade games and is planning to take him out. He is mad because Kool-Aid commericals happen all the time and he never gets to show up in a Kool-Aid commercial, while this main character teenager showed up in a Kool-Aid commercial 1 or 2 times. Our Kool-Aid man is in his mid 90s, but let himself go. He no longer fits in his traditional English clothing that he wore before. He is also mad about this too. He drinks a lot of alchoholic Kool-Aid, mainly rum.}

Our Kool-Aid man uses his super phone to charge up his ultra-mega teleport of legends, the only super phone ability capable of moving across such great distances. And he appears in the festival, which is also Anime Expo. He passes by the good main character guys but doesn't notice. He is out of quests on his \'93The Quest\'94 app. He did all of them, they all involved drinking Kool-Aid and rum shots. He doesn't like it at all. Our main good guy characters, the six femboys all go to on of the many arcades. The Kool-Aid guy goes there too. The Kool-Aid guy looks at our violet-eyed femboy but the femboy looks at him the wrong way. The Kool-Aid guy gets mad and requests politely that they take it online. This means that they have to play against each other in a video game at the arcade. They play \'93Revenge of the Swamp Monster 2: Gundam Edition\'94, which is a buggy precursor to a gundam game involving humanoid gundams. They get into tangerine mechs and at this point our Kool-Aid guy is the direct conflictor to our violet-eyed femboy. The Kool-Aid guy almost outmaneuvers out violet-eyed boy at the end, but fails and loses. He doesn't care because he almost won. In the background the swamp monster player Swampburt was rigging the match the whole time to make it so the Kool-Aid guy had the advantage, but was not successful. Swampburt plans his next charade, while the Kool-Aid guy goes to the local bar inside the arcade and drink 3 cocaine shots. He is too damn high. A middle aged super bald man sits next to him and asks for a Nogger Black. He eats the ice cream nonchallantly as the Kool-Aid guy considers getting a carbonated soda. He decides against it, as he only likes Kool-Aid mostly.}

In the back our six main character good guys spawn a \'93Playstation Virtual Reality Game Sphere\'94 to play the new \'93Revenge of the Swamp Monster\'94 virtual reality game. They are doing it to complete a quest on the \'93The Quest\'94 app to get more free stuff and things. They get into the game and it has updated graphics and new trees. The Swamp Monster main character who is conflicting them, gets ready to execute his plan. This time he decides to trap them inside of an ancient tree. About half the inside of the tree is covered in ancient tree sap that will get them stuck and they won't be able to get out ever. He figures there pretty good odds they'll step in it. }

They end up not stepping in the ancient tree sap. And then they leave the tree. The swamp monster main character is hiding behind another ancient tree adjacent to the ancient tree they just left and is waiting to jump scare them. Because he is green and hairy it is scarier than any ordinary swamp monster. He decides to jump out early because he stopped hearing their footsteps and kind of guestimated that they'd have been close enough already. He was wrong. They were pretty far away and it wasn't that scary. Aww shit, he says on the down low. The main character good guys read him good on the high up. \'93Damn I have been bested,\'94 says the swamp monster main character,\'94 It is now time to leave and start my next dastardly scheme.\'94 He knows what he is doing completely. Suddenly a giant blackout happens and the Virtual Reality goggles in our main character swamp monster player's house short circuits. He gets disconnected and his character logs out. He decides shortly afterwards that it is probably high time to head back to the festival to complete another quest on his \'93The Quest\'94 app from his super phone and starts up his teleporter app. It breaks and gets deleted. \'93real talk, this is not happening right now,\'94 he says dastardly-like. Meanwhile back in the swamp, the good guy main characters are mystified at how pro the main character swamp monster's play was, and just how pro is really was. The violet eyed-boy learned a new super power technique sort of from his quest, and so did the rest of his friends who are main character good guys. They finish the game for now and win, then leave and get back to real reality.}

So anyways, far away in a distant other place, our other main character who plays retrograde games and arcade games decides to go to the festival. He calls his hacker friend who hacks him a portal open on his commodore 64 with all PC Cdrom inclusive features and gets the portal open to the festival. He goes inside and is teleported. He meets up with the yellow-kool aid jug main character who just finished a quest to get a pair of virtual reality goggles. \'93This is so cool, I can now play \'93Revenge of the Swamp Monster\'94 on virtual reality, \'93 says the yellow-kool aid jug. He then uses his \'93Ze box\'94 duplicator app on his super phone which only has 1 charge to duplicate the virtual reality goggles. He gives the semi-identical pair to the arcade gamer main character.}

They can now all play the swamp monster game and are main characters. On the way back home to play the games all of them including the good guy main characters, they get a prophecy from Le man via the super phones. \'93Le it will be significant tu,\'94 is all it said. They decide to leave and it is unclear what will happen next.}

They decide to play \'93Revenge of the Swamp Monster\'94. All of our main character good guys lock into their new goggles. They look like cool 3D movie glasses with off-chaccarone frames. They get into the game and are in the swamp. Our arcade gamer and the yellow-kool aid jug went to the same house, which was the yellow-kool aid jug's house because it was the closest house to them both. They look super cool and put on the glasses to get into the \'93Revenge of the Swamp Monster\'94 video game virtual reality. They are using the Playstation Virtual Reality Game Sphere to play on the games. It is very interesting.}

Inside our swamp. There are several traps already set up, because our Swamp monster main character had preplanned it in advance. It seems unnecessary, but in reality it is. The traps that is. Render people trapped completely. But our main character good guys manage to avoid the first one, which is oddly enough right on their original spawn location. They get into the game slightly to the right via an intelligent adjustment. This is made possibly because of a seemingly discrete event. When buying an ice-cream at the festival, instead of going for the vanilla, our violet-eyed femboy chose the strawberry. Not on whim either. It was not at all surprising.}

Just two feet to the left, our arcade gamer main character from our yellow-kool aid jug realizes he's probably going to end up hitting the kool-aid jug by accident so he moves like 2 feet more to the right. Our arcade gamer main character is playing as a bald guy wandering through the swamp, looking for strange artifacts that no-one else wants to pay attention to. He is outside of the Swamp monster vs main character good guys conflict. He wanders a short distance before coming upon a pile of fossilized feces. Below it, he believes lies a small pile of sand. But instead of normal sand it is brown-yellow sand. Which is very unusual to say the least. Upon further inspection, it is clear to him that they are indeed extremely ancient feces. So ancient that all discernable water in the feces has dried up and became dew. He pokes it and it crumbles becoming a pile of brown-yellow sand. He pulls out his enormous brown speciman jar which looks like a ergemeiyer flask with brown glass and absorbs the entirety of the sand. It will likely become some type of hourglass of sorts. He checks his super phone from within the virtual simulation and realizes that the quest he never checked but was on, on the \'93The Quest\'94 app specifically says to collect the sand from the game. A long while later he'd work on it.}

Meanwhile our Swamp Monster main character is plotting his next dastardly scheme to try and trap our main character good guys again. He takes out a mole of chak, and begins to draw a giant shape of some sort. It is supposed to distract them to look at the chak drawing. It looks like a troll face without the features. Above the chak is a giant net that falls down when they step over it. Our Swamp Monster still isn't sure exactly how it works. But he doesn't really care right now.}

Just a short while away our arcade gamer main character has a sudden realization that the tree next to him has tree sap, likely from the previous game of \'93Revenge of the Swamp Monster\'94. It proves bunk. But inside the tree, if you knock on it three times, a drop of tree sap comes out. Very carefully and precisely, he knocks up the butt of the tree and like magic a drop of tree sap falls into his ergenmeiyer flask, this time a much smaller one that is yellow in color. The tree sap dew is amber-coloured.}

Aww-yeah\'94, says our violet eyed femboy. They just realized they had more quests here than before. But decided earlier not to check because he had bought the strawberry-ice cream instead of the vanilla. Seemingly innoucuously, they approach the giant chak drawing, and inside is just a seemingly ordinary patch of swamp flora. A squirrel scampers by in some remote corner of the swamp bordering a forest area just outside the swamp. The net falls a moment too soon and lands on the open chak space capturing nothing.}

The Kool-Aid guy next to our Arcade gamer main-character, decides that it is time to start up his gaming goggles. And he gets into the game extremely late. He walks in a straight line up to the door of the log cabin just on the outskirts of all the trees, to help our good\'97guy main characters win and knocks on the door. \'93Hello I am right here,\'94 he says.

 floor, a bag of chacarrones falls to the ground. He gets annoyed and picks it up placing it back on his desk. His virtual reality goggles fit snugly around his head. He is busy role-playing the swamp monster to plan his next dastardly scheme, but it seems that the path-way he wants to use to block our main character good guys from the house that the Kool-Aid man is at, is unavailable. He goes damn, that is not good, saying it out loud in real life words. The Kool-Aid man's nice big play seems to have done it. He is trying to jump out from behind the cabin and scare them all. But if he does that the Kool-Aid man will see him. If he succeeds they all run away scared. He realizes that this is the way they will get out of the swamp and win the level of \'93Revenge of the Swamp Monster\'94. They don't realize it yet, but want to win this level to get to the next level. The Kool-Aid man is not afraid of getting jump scared, so showing himself this early won't work. He knows this already. If he waits too long, he knows they'll likely hide behind the Kool-Aid man, the main character good guys that is. But if he doesn't wait at all something different might happen. So he runs out in the middle of the front porch of the log cabin where the Kool-Aid man is standing and screams, \'93Ooga Booga\'94. It is so stupid and unexpected that the Kool-Aid man gets scared anyways and slams into the front door opening the door. Our main character good guys realize this, also scared because of just how bizarre the decision was and run really quickly over inside the log cabin through the doorway that the Kool-Aid man opened getting inside the house. They complete the level.}

They all leave the game level of \'93Revenge of the Swamp Monster\'94 virtual reality version and recieve a quest on their \'93The Quest\'94 app to return to fortune teller. When the main character good guys reach the fortune teller's tent she is not inside the tent. The Swamp Monster main character is wandering around the tent area before getting in range of the fortune teller and completing his quest. The Kool-Aid man and the arcade gamer main character decide to wait a while before doing this and lounge around their apartment. The main character good guys take a look at the crystal ball. It does not have its swirling activity this time. After looking at it long enough they realize that they have to go somewhere else in the festival. It is actually outside of the festival, a carnival. It is right next to the festival though. They browse around the bizarre carnival. There are merry go rounds and a ferris wheel. A fortune teller machine lies dormant near a tent. They decide to go into the tent right next to it. Inside is a strange man in a minnish cap. He has his own fortune teller ball on a shelf in the corner of his store. It is old and dusty with lots of strange things lying around. There seem to be ancient gaming systems and PS2 in the corner. They walk past a virtual reality console without noticing it is there. The man is sitting at his counter looking at a sleeved binder full of unusual trading cards. He looks up cursorarily and exclaims something in English that they can barely hear properly. They immediately ask him why they are here. He guides them to a room to the right of the virtual reality consoles, inside are strange switchboards and devices. An old Atari 2600 lies dormant on one of the tables. There is a weed plant growing in the corner. A small tube TV sits so chalk full of dust the screen is completely grey. }

It gets dangerously close to incinerating his natural defence powers he possesses in the game. A chain of bullets repel the remainder of the main character good guys. The main character good guys fire a lot of aura beams and establish giant circle barriers around the vicinity. The giant mechanized suit beings to absorb a lot of the aura. The Swamp Monster throws the switch away and browses through his list of powers in his user interface. He selects one that he thinks will be good. Nothing seems to happen. The main character good guys are beginning to repel the giant mechanized suit and the suit begins to walk backwards firing several flares and rockets in their general direction.

A few armor sculptures adorn the outer ring and several long seats appear to have dust on them from long years of being there. They cross over the stone quarry afer a long while before realizing there isn't anything left to do but leave. The door is no longer locked they realize when the spiritual pressure of the door is low. They open the gates and leave the Colliseum in one piece. Outside the folliage of the swamp has grown denser.}

The Kool-Aid man main character and the arcade gamer main character arrive at the other side of the Colliseum, right next to the large pyramidal tower.

They pull out their erlinmeyer flask and hold it up and the light ends up shining too brightly. They put it back and decide its not ready yet.}

As everyone of the main characters near the colliseum walk away from it, the Colliseum and the pyramid sink back into the swamp revealing a path into the folliage. The Kool-aid man and the arcade gamer main character were right next to the path heading towards where the swamp monster went into and decided to walk towards it disappearing into the folliage as well. They are looking for their way around. The main character good guys find their way into the folliage afterwards taking an alternative route towards where they all went into, moving through the dense plants.}

The main character good guys decide to not follow the same path as the Kool-aid man and the arcade gamer main character which was clearly parted. The plants seemingly less dense to the right of the other path. They follow it, with a certainty that the Swamp Monster went in that general direction.

The Kool-aid man and the arcade gamer main character decide to leave the slab alone for now and head in the direction just behind the slab. It begins to seem like swamp folliage is clearing up a bit. They arrive at a swamp lake. No one appears to be around. Instead of approaching they decide to inspect the scenery first. Hold up, the Kool-aid man says holding them back.

The Swamp Monster moves through a straight path to his hideout as indicated on his GPS heads up display. As he gets close he notices that something is wrong. A stone slab sits erect next to a tree blocking his path. He wants to go around it but a stone slab out here seems to be out of the ordinary even for a game atmosphere. He walks around it anyways and heads into his hideout. After some time, he prepares his next trap.}
